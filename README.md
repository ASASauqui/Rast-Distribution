Rast Distribution is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu 18.04, it is designed for Artificial Intelligence Engineering students, considering all the necessary factors they may need during their first four semesters, from applications to programming languages. The members of the team that carried out this project tried to cover the needs that perhaps they, as AI students, would have liked to have from the beginning so as not to be damaging their equipment, installing things without knowing their functionality.
